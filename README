2D Boundary Element Method Solver for Quasi-Potential Incompressible Flows

Dependencies:
- LAPACK
- f2py (for python bindings)

1) ###################### Introduction & Motivation ###########################
bem2dlib is the result of an assignment for the Aeroelasticity course at Roma
Tre University in Rome. The code lacks documentation, testing and examples,
but when it was written respecting deadlines was our priority. We're not
planning to develop bem2dlib any further, but if somebody wants to step up to
finish the code or needs some help just send a mail to goriccardo@gmail.com

We're releasing the code in the wild hoping that it could be useful to some
aeronautical engineering student or anybody interested in BEM methods. Let us
know!


2) ########################## How To Get Started ##############################
To compile the library and the examples you will need a Fortran 90 compiler.
The code has been tested with gfortran on Linux only, so it may not work with
other compilers or platforms.
To get the code compiled just call:

$ make

To compile the python bindings (called bempy2d) call:

$ make python

To cleanup the directory (remove object files) call:

$ make clean
